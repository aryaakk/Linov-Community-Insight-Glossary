# Laravel Breeze - Nuxt.js Edition

## Inspiration
This project was created as community feature of linovhr

## Introduction

This repository is an implementation of the [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits) application / authentication starter kit frontend in [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org). All of the authentication boilerplate is already written for you - powered by [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum), allowing you to quickly begin pairing your beautiful Nuxt.js frontend with a powerful Laravel backend.

## Official Documentation

### Installation

Finally, run the application via `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`:

```
npm run dev
```
or
```
yarn dev
```

> Note: Currently, we recommend using `localhost` during local development of your backend and frontend to avoid CORS "Same-Origin" issues.
